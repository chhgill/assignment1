    <div class="title">Filling:</div>
    <div class="description">In some recipes, you're asked to "fill" your glass to the top with a final ingredient-- typically Champagne, club soda, or cream. The amount of liquid needed depends on how large your glass is: from 2 to 4 ounces for a flute, to anywhere from 4 to 8 ounces for rocks, highball, or Collins glasses.</div>

  <section class="technique">
    <div class="title">Floating:</div>
    <div class="description">To create pretty layers in the drink, "float" one liquid on top of the other. The easiest method is to invert a spoon and slowly pour liquor/liqueur over the back of the head, letting the liquid pool without breaking the cocktail's surface-- sort of like trying not to cry during <span class="ital">Of Mice and Men</span>.</div>

  <section class="technique">
    <div class="title">Icing punches:</div>
    <div class="description">For parties, blocks of ice are a cinch. Simply fill a clean, empty milk carton with water, freeze overnight, and peel away the waxy paper.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="technique">
    <div class="title">Muddling:</div>
    <div class="description">In some recipes, once you've filled a glass with the specified fruits, juices, or herbs, use a <span class="ital">muddler</span> to gently mash the ingredients, twisting lightly to release oils and flavors.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="technique">
    <div class="title">Rimming:</div>
    <div class="description">Rub the lip of the desired glass with a lemon or lime wedge, then "rim" the glass by turning it upside down and placing the rim on a plate of salt, cocoa powder, sugar, or whatever the recipe calls for. Then gently rotate the glass so the rim gets coated in the desired ingredient.</div>

  <section class="technique">
    <div class="title">Shaking:</div>
    <div class="description">Fill a <span class="ital">Cobbler</span> tin with all of the ingredients and ice, cap shut, and shake vigorously-- harder than you think, bordering on "workout". Uncap the lid and strain into a glass.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="technique">
    <div class="title">Stirring:</div>
    <div class="description">Experts use a bar spoon, which has a long, twisting handle, but an everyday cereal spoon will do just fine. For cocktails with carbonation, the bubbles do the stirring for you.</div>

  <section class="technique">
    <div class="title">Garnishes:</div>
    <div class="description">Like a truly memorable book cover (remember the puppeteer's hand on <span class="ital">The Godfather</span>?), garnishes are the promise of something special to come. Technically, <span class="ital">garnish</span> adds both color and flavor (like a lime wedge or a lemon twist), <span class="ital">garbage</span> is any food or fruit that's solely for aesthetic purposes (like a lemon wheel), and <span class="ital">kitsch</span> is something hokey (like an umbrella, or the entire plot of <span class="ital">Valley of the Dolls</span>).</div>
